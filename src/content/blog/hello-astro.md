[Astro](https://astro.build) is a little thing that can be used to build static sites, such as blogs.

It's _pretty_ fast.

I chose it for this blog since a full blown SSR framework like [SvelteKit](https://kit.svelte.dev) is not necessary for a simple little blog like this. Regardless, you can use Svelte components in Astro.

However, the most important reason for why I chose Astro is... _because of its icon_. I mean, it looks so nice! The brand identity of a product is the only reason I use them. Obviously this is a very educated decision.
