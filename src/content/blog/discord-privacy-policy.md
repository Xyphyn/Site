Recently Discord updated their terms of service, as visible by the **hundreds** of emails I got thanks to the buggy Outlook Android app.

Yeah, I installed that buggy outlook mess.

Before, on Discord's privacy policy, there was this quote:

> We generally do not store the contents of video or voice calls or channels. If we were to change that in the future (for example, to facilitate content moderation), we would disclose that to you in advance. We also donâ€™t store streaming content when you share your screen, but we do retain the thumbnail cover image for the stream for a short period of time.

That part has been removed from the new privacy policy, and will be effective March 27th.

While I doubt this means that Discord will start recording everything you do in there, I'm still gonna advertise some FOSS discord alternatives.

-   Element/Matrix: Uses the Matrix protocol
-   [Revolt](https://revolt.chat): An alternative platform with similar features to Discord.
-   Good ol' IRC.
-   Mastering telepathic communication and utilizing that to communicate with others.
